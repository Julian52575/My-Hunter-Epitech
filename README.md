# My_Hunter Epitech Nancy 2022
Our first CSFML / Graphic project.    
Mine even has a few RPG element added to it, such as HPs, different characters or ennemies.   
Feel free to git clone and learn from my code ! And even play it !    
And if you are interested, I have included the powerpoint I used for my code review, in which I give more insight on my game !
