# My_Hunter Epitech Nancy 2022
My first CSFML project.    
We were supposed to recreate [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) but I decided to do [Mother3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3) instead, that meant I had to code some RPG element on top of the simple shooter game.   
This is mainly a proof of concept but feel free to    
```git clone git@github.com:Julian52575/My-Hunter-Epitech.git```    
```make```    
and play it !    
And if you are interested, I have included the powerpoint I used for my code review, in which I give more insight on my first ever game !   

*note : you need to have the csfml librairy installed on your computer. To do so, exectue the bash script found on this GitHub :
